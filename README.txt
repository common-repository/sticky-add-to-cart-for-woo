Sticky add to cart for Woo places a fixed floating cart in your choice of 3 positions, top, bottom or slide in from the right that displays price, image, stock status, add to cart button and more

== Description ==

Modern WooCommerce websites need a modern solution for large product galleries and long descriptions. If you're a shopper and you are scrolling down a page reading a description or looking at images, you can quickly lose sight, quite figuratively of the important information about a product, including the main call to action, the add to cart button. Sticky add to cart for Woo aims to solve that problem by always keeping the button visible on the page at all times.

** How can this benefit your store? **

If you look at many of the top performing ecommerce stores they mostly have a few things in common, and a cart area that's always visible on the page is one of them. By keeping the most important call to action of the product page constantly visible it increases your chances of a conversion.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I customise the look of Sticky add to cart for Woo? =

In the free version you can customise to an extent. You can decide what elements are visible, but not the colours and font sizes. If you want to customise it further the pro version will allow you to fully customise the display of the plugin.

= Does this work with variable products? =

Yes. This plugin works with variable products. Keep in mind that due to the limited space available, especially on mobile devices, you may want to replace the variation selector with the quick link button which will scroll the screen to the variations in the short description.
